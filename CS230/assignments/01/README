This is the first part of the CS230 first assignment.

It reads values out of three files: Level1_Counter.txt, Level2_counter.txt,
and Level2_Lives.txt.

It will simulate the game states running for a fixed amount of time, checking
input and changing states, with the appropriate support functions, as needed.

This does not otherwise take any input from the user.

All output will show up in Output.txt.
