\begin{enumerate}

\item Who are the characters?

"Jammer" and "Bud", two divers.
They are experienced explorers, but a recent accident in the area has resulted in them needing to search inside a decrepit facility.

\item Where does it take place?

Inside a flooded missile facility.

\item Whose story is it?

Jammer; Bud is attempting to assist him in his mission to find out what happened in the facility and locate any survivors.

\item What changes from the beginning to end?

The viewer should realize that Jammer isn't used to dealing with emergencies that concern actual people -- catastrophic events on his journies he can handle, but not things happening to people he knows.

\item Where is the turning moment?

When Budd calms Jammer down but Jammer admits that he can't continue.

\item How should we feel about what happens?

Jammer is essentially giving up -- he's failing to press onwards, and this should create a sense of tension to set the stage for the rest of the story involving him overcoming this weakness.

\item What happens?

The two divers enter the abandoned missile silo and discover a corpse wearing a uniform they recognize.
Jammer does not take this well, and Bud has to calm him down before proceeding on his own.
