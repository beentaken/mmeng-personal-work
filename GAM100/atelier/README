Title: Atelier README File
Author: Marcus Meng

Atelier is a game in which the player attempts to construct magical circuits that transfer sufficient power of an appropriate elemental aspect into a spell they are constructing.

#Requirements#

To build:

* Python, if you want to use the waf auto-build system.
* GCC 4.3 or higher, or an alternative C99-compatible compiler.

It should compile correctly with the command line:

	gcc -o atelier -std=c99 -Wextra -Wall -pedantic -DNDEBUG

waf, of course, should handle this automatically.

To run:

* A command line interface.

#Modifying the Source#

To add new gamestates, add a new entry to the enum in states.h, then add a case for that entry in the loop function in game.c. You will probably want to create a new header and source file for your gamestate and include it in game.h.

To add new commands, add a new entry to the commands enum in definitions.h, and add a method to deal with it in the get_command function in parser.c. Add a case for the command in the states you want the command to be valid in.
