This is the second assignment for CS250.

This assignment is incomplete: it does not read from the input file (the tank specs are hardcoded),
and there are glitches with the triangle rasterizer that causes triangles to shoot all over the place
at some view angles.

It does, however, feature a stack-based method of passing on transformations to sub-geometry, and
does take input. All in all, it's not particularly impressive...

Better luck next time, etc.
