\section{Conclusion}

For the most part, an object rolling down a ramp follows the same overall rules as an object sliding down the same ramp.
The main consideration is the relative lack of influence of kinetic friction on the motion, and the fact that it will (somewhat surprisingly, since my knee-jerk reaction was that rolling things tended to move faster) generally
move more slowly than an object sliding, assuming relatively low kinetic friction in the sliding case.
